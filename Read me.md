The "Data" file is only for the VRP with time window problem, not the classic model. Besides, in this problem we ignore the unloading time, so the unloading time won't affect any of the process, and there's no constraints about the load of vehicle. if you need to consider the load in this problem, you need to add constraints about the load yourself. See other details about the model in following pics:
